 Solar System Project

This project simulates the solar system, allowing users to visualize the planets, their moons, and the orbits around the Sun. It aims to provide an interactive way to explore the solar system's celestial bodies while demonstrating basic orbital mechanics.

Features
- Orbital Simulation Real-time simulation of planetary orbits around the Sun.
- Planetary Models 3D visualizations of planets and their major moons (if applicable).
-User Interaction Users can zoom, rotate, and explore different parts of the solar system.
- **Educational Content Provides basic information about each planet, moon, and other celestial bodies.
  
 Technologies Used
- Programming Language [e.g., Python, JavaScript]
- Libraries/Frameworks**: 
  - [e.g., Pygame, Three.js, Matplotlib, or others depending on your implementation]
  - [Other dependencies such as NumPy, Plotly, etc.]
